Budget worksheet, v1

This is a rough, synthetic budget outline intended for hackathon triage only.

Major cost categories
- Study coordinator effort: TBD hours
- Data extraction and analyst time: TBD hours
- Tooling costs: analytics workspace, storage, and any model usage
- Vendor costs: None indicated
- Compliance and review overhead: IRB prep, security review if tools and vendors are involved

Open questions
- Who pays for vendor services, sponsor or institution
- Whether tool usage involves metered compute or inference costs
- Whether security assessments introduce additional cost or timeline impacts
