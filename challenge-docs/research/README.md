# Research Track (Research Compliance Intake Triage) Hackathon Assets (Non-binary)

This folder contains **4 distinct cases** with diverse scenarios and attachments designed to stress-test an agentic intake workflow.

## Layout

- `research/assets/`  
  - Primary intake CSV for the track (source of truth)
  - Optional policy snippets and shared reference notes

- `research/proj-###/`  
  - Per-case attachments as `.txt` and `.json` (no PDFs, no images)

## Notes

- Attachments are intentionally imperfect: partial, ambiguous, or mildly contradictory in places.
- IDs are stable and referenced in the intake CSV.
